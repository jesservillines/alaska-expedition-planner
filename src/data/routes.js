    firstAscent: "1970s, Harvard Mountaineering Club",
    characteristics: "A historical classic established in the 1970s, featuring sustained mixed climbing on granite with intermittent ice sections. The route follows a prominent face and has well-documented beta.",
    crux: "Several exposed 5.9 pitches with limited protection options on granite face",
    trafficLevel: "Moderate – one of the better‐known routes; occasionally repeated by experienced teams",
    landingZone: "Ruth Glacier",
    approach: "Typically accessed via a fly-in to the Ruth Glacier followed by a short ski/hike to the Huntington base",
    conditionWindow: "Late April/early May: cold enough to keep ice firm yet open for mixed climbing; may see some snowmelt at lower sections",

    firstAscent: "1980s",
    characteristics: "A less-committed, more direct rock route up a prominent pillar on Huntington's face. Offers mostly free climbing with some optional aid moves in poorer sections. Relatively well-protected with established gear placements.",
    crux: "Aid moves around A0 with limited protection in a few sections",
    trafficLevel: "Fair – more popular with climbing parties seeking an 'intro' to Huntington's vertical potential; modest traffic in spring",

    approach: "Land on Ruth Glacier via ski plane, then traverse to the base of the Lowell Pillar (short hike/ski of ~30–45 min)",

    firstAscent: "1990s",
    characteristics: "Climbs a steep, narrow couloir that starts with 5–10 pitches of firm, steep ice and transitions into mixed climbing. The route's namesake comes from a dramatic snow cave formation mid-route, offering unique beta.",
