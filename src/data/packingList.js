  specialConsiderations: [
    "Weight is crucial for fly-in expeditions - air taxis have strict weight limits (typically 125 lbs per person including body weight).",
    "Temperatures in the Ruth Gorge can drop to -20째F even in spring - gear must be rated appropriately.",
    "The sun can be extremely intense on the glacier - proper eye and skin protection is essential.",
    "Moisture management is critical - ensure sleeping bags and insulating layers stay dry.",
    "Group gear can be distributed among team members to balance weight."
  ],
  
  weightOptimization: [
    "Consider equipment sharing among team members (stoves, tents, ropes, protection).",
    "Evaluate each item's necessity based on your specific objectives and time of year.",
    "Bring repair capabilities rather than redundant items where possible.",
    "Food planning should balance weight with caloric needs (typically 3,000-4,000 calories per day).",
    "Pre-package meals to reduce packaging waste and weight."
